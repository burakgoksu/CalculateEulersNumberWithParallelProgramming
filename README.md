# CalculateEulersNumberWithParallelProgramming

In this repository, I calculated the Euler's Number in 3 different ways.
Firts one (EulerWithMultiprocessing), I did it with multiprocessing
Second one (EulerWithThreads), I did it with threads
Last one (MCEulerWithMultiprocessing), I developed a multiprocessing algorithm with a monte carlo simulation.
